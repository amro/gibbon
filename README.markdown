# gibbon

Gibbon is a simple API wrapper for interacting with [MailChimp API](http://www.mailchimp.com/api) 1.3.

##Installation

    $ gem install gibbon

##Requirements

A MailChimp account and API key. You can see your API keys [here](http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api).

##Usage

There are a few ways to use Gibbon:

You can create an instance of the API wrapper:

    gb = Gibbon.new("your_api_key")
    
You can set your api_key globally and call class methods:

    Gibbon.api_key = "your_api_key"
    Gibbon.lists

You can also set the environment variable 'MAILCHIMP_API_KEY' and Gibbon will use it when you create an instance:

    u = Gibbon.new

Fetching data is as simple as calling API methods directly on the wrapper object.
Check the API [documentation](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/api/1.3/) for details.

### Fetching Campaigns

For example, to fetch your first 100 campaigns (page 0):

    campaigns = gb.campaigns({:start => 0, :limit => 100})

### Fetching Lists

Similarly, to fetch your first 100 lists:

    lists = gb.lists({:start => 0, :limit=> 100})

### More Advanced Examples

Getting batch member information for subscribers looks like this:

    info = gb.list_member_info({:id => list_id, :email_address => email_array})

or

    info = gb.listMemberInfo({:id => list_id, :email_address => email_array})

Fetch open and click detail for recipients of a particular campaign:

    email_stats = gb.campaign_email_stats_aim({:cid => campaign_id, :email_address => email_array})

or

    email_stats = gb.campaignEmailStatsAIM({:cid => campaign_id, :email_address => email_array})

### Other Stuff

Gibbon defaults to a 30 second timeout. You can optionally set your own timeout (in seconds) like so:

    gb.timeout = 5

### Notes

As of 0.1.6, gibbon uses ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(). This means code that checked for weird API responses (like "true"
on a successful call to "listSubscribe" or similar) will need to be tweaked to handle the boolean JSON.decode() returns
as opposed to the string the MailChimp API returns. I understand the extra dependency might be a pain for some.
